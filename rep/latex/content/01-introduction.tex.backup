\chapter{Introduction}
The main objective for this report is to propose a \acf{LNA} front-end for extracellular\footnote{\emph{extracellular} means "outside the cell"} in-vito\footnote{\emph{in-vivo} is Latin for "within the living"}
neural signal recording, as well as to research what requirements can be considered critical in achieving such a design. As a natural consequence of the main objective, the project - which this report is a
product of - will explore the usage of \acs{CMOS} technology in neural recording systems. Any findings produced can therefore be used as a preliminary for further research in the authors upcoming graduate thesis. 
Thus, some basic elaborations on where the design can potentially be situated in a complete neural recording system - such as a bio-medical \acs{IC} or a \acs{CMOS} \acs{MEMS} probe, will be undergone.

\section{Report Outline}
The report is organized in the following manner:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chapter 2} briefly presents the motivational background for neural recording before digging into the relevant theory needed to understand the design 
		  itself as well as eventual limitations and difficulties in realizing the best possible specifications. 
		  It also provides a basic theoretical understanding of the neural recording principles from an electronic designers point of view - namely how \acs{LNA} to interface
		  with intercranial electrodes.
